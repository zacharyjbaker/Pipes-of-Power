# Moeleth, the Demon of Discord, has been returned to world!
### It has besieged the City of Halavar with its horde of Oculoi, after possessing the body of the Ogre King Krexova.
### The city's defenders are scattered, and the defenses lay shattered. But, a nameless bard, the wielder of the Pipes of Power, stands alone, and faces Moeleth and its forces.
### This is the tale of their mythical duel.
